- Lightweight and highly optimized

## ðŸ“˜ API

```luau
FastTask.spawn(f: (...any) -> ()) -> thread
-- Works similarly to task.spawn but reuses coroutines.

FastTask.defer(f: (...any) -> ()) -> thread
-- Works similarly to task.defer with pooling.

FastTask.delay(delay: number, f: (...any) -> ()) -> thread
-- Works similarly to task.delay with pooling.
